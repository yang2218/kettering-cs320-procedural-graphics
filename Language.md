# Introduction #

What language should we use for the project (or at least the core parts of it)?

(Add comments for discussion. And please edit this wiki page to add any facts/points you'd like to put on the table, right now it's one person's biased view)

# Suggested Languages #

## C/C++ ##
### Pros ###
  * Very similar to Java, meaning it is easy to figure out if you don't already know how to use it, since we all learned Java at one point
### Cons ###
  * Death by pointers
### Notes ###
(Beccah) I'm mainly voting for this option because I don't know C#.

## C# ##
### Pros ###
  * Modern language, Java-like (but better)
  * Nice syntax features
  * Managed memory (no unsafe pointers, memory leaks, segfault crashes, etc.)
  * If you want, you can run C# code on Linux using Mono
### OpenTK Pros ###
  * OpenTK takes advantage of C# syntax features, strong typing, etc. to make coding with OpenGL less error-prone.
  * Inline documentation allows you to get information on any OpenGL function from within your IDE (if using VS or other IDE for Mono/C# code).
  * Helper libraries for 3D math, etc.
### Cons ###
  * ?
### Notes ###
